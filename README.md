# Rustbot: Your Gemini-Powered Terminal Chatbot

Rustbot is a terminal-based chatbot that allows you to interact with Google's Gemini AI model directly from your command line.  Built with Rust for performance and security, Rustbot
provides a convenient and efficient way to harness the power of AI in your daily workflow.

## Features

* **Gemini Integration:** Seamlessly connect to Google's Gemini API for engaging and informative conversations.
* **Secure API Key Storage:** Stores your Gemini API key locally. *Security is paramount! Please be mindful of your API key and protect it accordingly.*
* **Persistent Chat History:**  Rustbot saves your chat history locally, enabling you to pick up conversations where you left off. The history is also formatted to be compatible with
Gemini's API for maintaining context.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Rust Toolchain:**  You need to have Rust installed.  If you don't have it already, download and install it from
[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

* **Gemini API Key:** Obtain a Gemini API key from the [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/OtavioGonzaga/rustbot.git rustbot
```

#### Or download the source code

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OtavioGonzaga/rustbot.git
    cd rustbot
    ```

2. **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    cargo build --release
    ```

3. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    ./target/release/rustbot
    ```

### Configuration

1. **Set your Gemini API Key:**  The first time you run `rustbot`, it will prompt you to enter your Gemini API key. This key will be stored securely in a local configuration file.

2. **Customization:** (More details coming soon!)  Future versions will allow you to customize the chatbot's behavior, including:

    * Pre-defined prompts.
    * Conversation history settings.
    * Output formatting.

## Usage

Simply run the `rustbot` executable, and you'll be greeted with a prompt. Start typing your questions or commands, and Rustbot will communicate with the Gemini API to provide responses.

‚ñê Hello, Gemini! Tell me a joke.

## Roadmap

Future plans for Rustbot include:

* **New Models:** Add new IA models, like ChatGPT or CloudeAI.

* **Enhanced Chat Management:** Provide users with comprehensive control over their chat sessions:
  * **Create New Chats:** Allow users to start multiple, distinct chat sessions.
  * **Delete Chats:** Provide the ability to permanently remove unwanted chat histories.
  * **Rename Chats:** Enable users to assign meaningful names to their chat sessions for easy organization.
  * **List Chats:**  Provide a command to list all available chat sessions.
  * **Clear Chat:** Allow users to clear the history of the current chat session without deleting it entirely.

* **Remote & Synchronized Conversations:** Implement secure, cloud-based storage of chat conversations, enabling seamless synchronization across multiple devices.  This will allow you to
access your Rustbot history from anywhere.  Security and user privacy will be a top priority in designing this feature.

* **Enhanced Message Input:** Significantly improve the message input experience with features such as:
  * **Multi-line Input:**  Support multi-line input using a special escape sequence or dedicated command for composing longer, more complex prompts.
  * **Input History:**  Implement a command history (using up/down arrow keys) for easy access to previous queries.
  * **Syntax Highlighting:** Consider adding syntax highlighting for code snippets within the input prompt.

* **Improved Markdown Rendering:** Enhance the display of Markdown generated by the Gemini API.  This will include:
  * **Support for Tables:** Properly render tables for better readability.
  * **Enhanced Code Blocks:** Improve the presentation of code blocks with syntax highlighting and potentially copy-to-clipboard functionality.
  * **Customizable Styles:** Allow users to customize the Markdown rendering style (themes) to their preferences.
